Built for a class of mine at UTK, this was a very basic attempt at interfacing with CUDA through python. As I did not have a CUDA-capable graphics card at the time, this "just barely" worked at the time, and I've not used the code since.

These days, I prefer to do my matrix manipulations through Tensorflow, who manages the GPU (should a compatible one be available) for me. :)
